# Our Vision

Through our clinics and individual lessons, we &trade;ocus on developing a hybrid of techniques used in both Box and Field lacrosse. By helping to impart the values of this indigenous game, we hope to better prepare your child for the direction this game is moving, while imparting the values needed to engage your child in a life of respect, commitment, responsibility, and gratitude.
